# Transformer-Fine-tuning
Fine-tuned a pretrained transformer model (DistilBERT) for binary sentiment classification on the IMDB dataset using PyTorch and Hugging Face. Implemented tokenization, training, and evaluation pipelines with GPU acceleration in Google Colab to enable efficient and reproducible experimentation.
